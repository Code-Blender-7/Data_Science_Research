About File :
The code is simply to collect the best repos that are shared the most in python. the code collects the data from the github's API address. Simply the address
gives raw data with if we turn that data into a directory then we can create a cool Pygal histogram presentration. 



Origin : 
The Github's_most_shared_repos is a training project that i learned from Eric Mattrew's Python Crash Course. If you want to find the specific details, 
the file tutorial is at Pg 422 of 562. 
Please note that the plot_dict dictionary has an error. I am not sure but there were errors of Decode while rendering the data. I spent my time to research 
and see what i could do to make the error removed. That's why i have written this code

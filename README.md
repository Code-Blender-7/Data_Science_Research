# <i>Repo Details -</i> 

This is where all the data visualization based projects are done
All files in folder are done with multiple scripts of code.     


While navigating the folders, be sure to look out for their readme files. They are very helpful to get your attention to what files you be looking at. <br>


Data Science projects of python may also contain [.ipynb](https://fileinfo.com/extension/ipynb) files. If you know how to use such files, feel free to roam around.

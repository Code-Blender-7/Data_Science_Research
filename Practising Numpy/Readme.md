Theses files are used to recap basic, intermediate and advanced tests to show the power of using Numpy. 

You can use these script files to learn the opeartors and the key syntax of the features that the numpy offers. 
This field is certain to be expanded over time as more reasearch files are to be added. 

Please do not link the folder on your works as that the structure of this repository may be mutated.

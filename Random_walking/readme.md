# hello there

# The random walking is a program where you let the computer pick a number, turn it into a value and then place that number as a position dot in the graph by using the matplotlib
# module. In short - Pick a number > turn the number in a value of x , y axis and then place that value in a graph. 

# In this code, every dot you see is picked by the computer. In short, These numbers are dot. 
# the code is using the layout of scatter where the values are dots, not plot. 

# Take your time understanding this code as i had fun doing so. 


# if you got any questions, Feel free to ask me on twitter :)

# hello there

The random walking is a program where you let the computer pick a number, turn it into a value and then place that number as a position dot in the graph by using the matplotlib
module. In short - Pick a number > turn the number in a value of x , y axis and then place that value in a graph. 


After runnning the script, You should be seeing a cluster of dots like this

Every dot you see is picked by the computer. In short, These numbers are dot. 
the code is using the layout of scatter where the values are dots, not plot. 


Take your time understanding this code as i had fun doing so.
